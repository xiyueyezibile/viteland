Welcome to our powerful static site generator based on Vite! This tool not only provides a rich development experience but also supports writing React components in Markdown files and has a powerful default full-text search theme. Let's start quickly creating your static site.

## Introduction
Our static site generator has the following core features:

- üöÄ Based on Vite: Provides a fast development and build experience.
- üìù MDX support: Allows you to seamlessly write and use React components in Markdown files.
- üî• Full-featured search theme: Supports features such as multilingual (i18n), making your website content retrieval more efficient.
- üèùÔ∏è Island architecture: Improves performance by reducing client bundle size and achieving partial hydration.

## Quick Start

```js
npm install -g viteland
vl dev
```

## Writing Content
Create a Markdown file:

In the content directory, create a new Markdown file (e.g., index.mdx), write your content, and add React components:

```js

interface MyComponentProps {
  title: string;
}

const MyComponent: React.FC<MyComponentProps> = ({ title }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{title}</h1>
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;


import MyComponent from '../MyComponent'

<MyComponent title='hello world' />

```
You can directly use React components in this file, such as <MyComponent title='hello world' />

## Configuring the Project:

Create or modify the configuration file (e.g., config.js) in the project's docs directory to define the basic information, navigation, search, and other functions of the site.

Here is a basic configuration example:
```js
export default {
  title: 'Viteland', // Site title
  themeConfig: {
    // Navigation bar configuration
    nav: [
      { text: "Home", link: "/" },
      { text: "Guide", link: '/guide/' }
    ],
    // Sidebar configuration
    sidebar: {
      '/guide/': [
        {
          text: 'Guide',
          items: [
            {
              text: 'Quick Start',
              link: '/guide/a'
            },
            {
              text: 'How to Install',
              link: '/guide/b'
            },
            {
             text: 'Precautions',
             link: '/guide/c'
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Deployment
After selecting the deployment platform, upload the files in the build directory according to the platform requirements to complete the website launch.
